Step-1:
Execute the following to begin the key creation
command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yasir@onwire.pk"
Above command will create a new SSH key using the email as a label


Step-2:
Enter a file in which to save the key."
You can specify a file location or press "Enter" to accept the default file location.


Step-3:
Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter] 


Step-4:
The next prompt will ask for a secure passphrase. A passphrase will add an additional layer of security to the SSH and will be required anytime the SSH key is used. If someone gains access to the computer that private keys are stored on, they could also gain access to any system that uses that key. Adding a passphrase to keys will prevent this scenario.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
At this point, a new SSH key will have been generated at the previously specified file path.


Step-5:
Add the new SSH key to the ssh-agent
The ssh-agent is responsible for holding private keys. Think of it like a keychain. In addition to holding private keys it also brokers requests to sign SSH requests with the private keys so that private keys are never passed around unsecurly.
Before adding the new SSH key to the ssh-agent first ensure the ssh-agent is running by executing:

Command:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Once the ssh-agent is running the following command will add the new SSH key to the local SSH agent.

Step-6:
Running the below command, adds the specified private key (id_rsa) to the SSH authentication agent. 
This allows you to use the corresponding public key for authentication when connecting to remote servers via SSH without entering a password each time.
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Step-7:
This command prints the contents of the public key file id_rsa.pub located in the .ssh directory in your home directory. 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
